## Target Cities Strategy

### Option A: Start Local
Focus on businesses within 50 miles of you:
- Easier to offer in-person meetings
- Can visit and drop off samples
- Build local case studies first

### Option B: Major Metro Areas
Target large cities with more funeral homes:
- Philadelphia, PA
- New York, NY
- Los Angeles, CA
- Chicago, IL
- Houston, TX
- Phoenix, AZ
- Dallas, TX
- Atlanta, GA
- Miami, FL
- Boston, MA

### Option C: Underserved Markets
Smaller cities where you might face less competition:

- Retirement communities (Florida, Arizona)
- Historic areas with old cemeteries

## Prioritizing Prospects

### High Priority (Contact First)
- Family-owned funeral homes (decision-maker is reachable)
- Monument companies with showrooms (already selling add-ons)
- Funeral homes with good Google reviews (they care about service)
- Businesses with outdated websites (need modern solutions)

### Medium Priority
- Cemetery offices (slower decision process)
- Chain funeral homes (need to find local manager)
- Large monument companies (more competition for attention)

### Lower Priority (Contact Later)
- Corporate funeral chains (SCI/Dignity Memorial) - harder to reach decision makers
- Very small operations (1-person shops) - less volume potential

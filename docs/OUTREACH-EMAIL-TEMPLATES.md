## FUNERAL HOMES - Affiliate Program

### Template 1: Initial Outreach (Short)

**Subject:** Help families preserve memories + earn $15/referral

```
Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because [Funeral Home Name] clearly cares about helping families through difficult times.

I built Headstone Legacy - a free service that lets families create digital memorials with photos, stories, and life timelines. We also make weatherproof QR code tags that attach to headstones, so anyone who visits can scan and see the full memorial.

I'm looking for funeral home partners to recommend this to families. You'd earn $15 for every QR tag sold through your referral link.

- No cost to join
- No inventory to manage
- We handle everything

Would you be open to a quick call this week to see if it's a fit?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Template 2: Initial Outreach (Detailed)

**Subject:** A meaningful service to offer grieving families

```
Hi [First Name],

I hope this finds you well. I came across [Funeral Home Name] while researching funeral homes in [City/Region] that genuinely care about the families they serve.

I wanted to introduce you to Headstone Legacy - a service I built to help families preserve and share the stories of their loved ones.

Here's how it works:
1. Families create a free digital memorial with photos, stories, and a life timeline
2. They can order a weatherproof QR code tag ($39) that attaches to the headstone
3. Anyone who visits the grave can scan the code and see the full memorial

It's a beautiful way for families to ensure their loved one's story lives on - not just a name and two dates on a stone.

I'm building a partner program for funeral homes like yours. When you recommend Headstone Legacy to families:
- You earn $15 for every QR tag they purchase
- We handle all production, shipping, and support
- There's no cost or inventory for you

Many families don't know this option exists until someone tells them. You're already having these conversations - this just gives you something meaningful to offer.

Would you have 15 minutes this week for a quick call? I'd love to show you how it works and answer any questions.

Thank you for your time,

### Template 3: Follow-Up #1 (3-4 days later)

**Subject:** Re: Help families preserve memories + earn $15/referral

```
Hi [First Name],

Just wanted to follow up on my email from earlier this week.

I know you're busy helping families, so I'll keep this short: Headstone Legacy lets families create digital memorials that live forever. We make QR tags for headstones so visitors can scan and see photos, stories, and memories.

As a partner, you'd earn $15 per tag sold - with zero cost or effort on your end.

Here's a 2-minute demo: [Link to demo memorial or video]

Worth a quick look?

### Template 4: Follow-Up #2 (7-10 days later)

**Subject:** Last follow-up - partnership opportunity

```
Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this brief since I haven't heard back.

Headstone Legacy helps families preserve memories with digital memorials + QR tags for headstones. Our funeral home partners earn $15 per tag with zero effort.

If this isn't the right time, no worries at all. But if you'd like to learn more, just reply "interested" and I'll send over the details.

Either way, I appreciate what you do for families in [City].

Best,
[Your Name]

## MONUMENT/HEADSTONE COMPANIES - Wholesale Program

### Template 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Add $30+ profit to every headstone sale

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: What if you could add a $49 upsell to every headstone you sell - with $30+ profit margin?

I make weatherproof QR code tags that attach to headstones. Families scan the code to see a digital memorial with photos, stories, and memories.

At wholesale pricing:
- 10+ tags: $25 each (sell at $49-59 = $24-34 profit)
- 25+ tags: $20 each (sell at $49-59 = $29-39 profit)
- 50+ tags: $15 each (sell at $49-59 = $34-44 profit)

It's an easy add-on when someone is already spending $3,000-5,000 on a headstone. And families love it.

Want me to send you a sample tag to see the quality?

### Template 2: Initial Outreach (Story-focused)

**Subject:** The question families are starting to ask

```
Hi [First Name],

Have you had families ask about QR codes for headstones yet?

It's becoming more common - families want a way to share more than just a name and dates. They want visitors to see photos, read stories, and really know the person.

I built Headstone Legacy to solve this. We make laser-engraved stainless steel QR tags that:
- Withstand all weather (rated 50+ years)
- Link to a beautiful digital memorial
- Take 2 minutes to install

I'm looking for monument companies to partner with. At wholesale ($15-25/tag depending on volume), you can sell these at $49-59 and pocket $30+ per sale.

It's a natural add-on to your existing business - and a genuine service families appreciate.

Interested in seeing a sample? I'll ship one free.

Best,
[Your Name]
Founder, Headstone Legacy

### Template 3: Follow-Up for Monument Companies

**Subject:** Re: Add $30+ profit to every headstone sale

```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note about QR memorial tags.

The quick pitch: weatherproof QR tags that link to digital memorials. You buy wholesale ($15-25/tag), sell at $49-59, keep the profit.

I'd love to send you a free sample to see the quality. Just reply with your shipping address and I'll get one out this week.

Best,
[Your Name]

## CEMETERY OFFICES - Affiliate Program

### Template 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Digital memorials for [Cemetery Name] families

```
Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out to cemetery administrators who might be interested in offering a modern service to the families they serve.

Headstone Legacy lets families create digital memorials - complete with photos, stories, life timelines, and family connections. We also make weatherproof QR code tags that attach to headstones, so anyone visiting can scan and see the full memorial.

For cemeteries, this means:
- A valuable service to offer families (free to create, $39 for the QR tag)
- No cost or inventory for your office
- $15 commission for every QR tag sold through your referral

Some cemeteries are even featuring QR-enabled memorials in their directories, making it easier for visitors to find and learn about those resting there.

Would you be interested in learning more? I'm happy to set up a quick demo.

Best,
[Your Name]

### When They Say "What's the catch?"

```
Ha! Fair question. There really isn't one.

- Free to join (no fees ever)
- No inventory to buy or store
- No customer service to handle
- We pay you $15 for each tag sold through your link

The only "catch" is that you need to actually mention it to families for it to work. But since you're already talking to them about memorial options, it's a natural fit.

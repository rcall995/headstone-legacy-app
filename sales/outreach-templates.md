## COLD EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Email 1: Initial Outreach (Funeral Homes)

**Subject Lines (test these):**
- New revenue opportunity for [Funeral Home Name]
- Quick question about [City] families
- Adding value to your memorial services

```
Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because [Funeral Home Name] has a strong reputation in [City] for compassionate family service.

I wanted to introduce a new offering that many funeral homes are adding: QR Memorial Tags. These small, weatherproof tags attach to headstones and let visitors scan to see a full digital memorial - photos, stories, family history.

For funeral homes, it's:
- A new revenue stream ($30-50+ profit per tag)
- Zero inventory to carry (we ship direct)
- Something families genuinely appreciate

Would you have 10 minutes this week for a quick call? I can show you a demo and explain how the wholesale program works.

Best,
[Your Name]
Headstone Legacy
[Phone]
[Email]

P.S. I can send over a sample tag if you'd like to see the quality firsthand.

### Email 2: Initial Outreach (Monument Companies)

**Subject Lines:**
- Partner opportunity for [Company Name]
- Adding digital to your monuments
- Quick idea for [Company Name]

```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] does beautiful work - I was looking at some of the monuments you've done in [City/Area].

I'm wondering if you've considered adding QR memorials to your offerings? It's a growing trend where a small QR tag on the headstone links to a digital memorial with photos and stories.

For monument companies, it's a natural add-on sale:
- Wholesale pricing starts at $20/tag
- Suggested retail $59-79
- We handle production and can drop-ship
- Complements rather than competes with your core business

Several monument companies are bundling it with premium packages. Happy to share what's working for them.

Worth a quick conversation?

Best,
[Your Name]
Headstone Legacy

### Email 3: Initial Outreach (Cemeteries)

**Subject Lines:**
- Enhancing visitor experience at [Cemetery Name]
- Digital memorials for [Cemetery Name]
- Modern addition for [Cemetery Name] families

```
Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out to [Cemetery Name] about something that's becoming popular at cemeteries across the country: QR memorial tags.

These weatherproof tags let families add a digital component to their loved one's gravesite. Visitors scan with their phone and see photos, biography, and family history. No app needed.

For cemeteries, it:
- Provides a premium service to offer families
- Creates potential revenue stream (wholesale pricing available)
- Enhances visitor experience
- Helps with genealogy research

Would [Cemetery Name] be interested in learning more? I can set up a quick demo call or send information to review.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Headstone Legacy

### Email 4: Follow-Up #1 (3 days after initial)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

```
Hi [First Name],

Just following up on my email from earlier this week about QR Memorial Tags.

I know you're busy, so here's the quick version:
- Families love them (it's more than just dates on stone)
- You make $30-50 per tag with no inventory
- 5-minute setup for families

Here's a 2-minute video showing how it works: [link]

Happy to answer any questions or set up a quick call.

[Your Name]
```

### Email 5: Follow-Up #2 (7 days after initial)

**Subject:** One more thing - [First Name]

```
Hi [First Name],

Last email from me on this - I don't want to be a pest!

Just wanted to mention: I'm happy to send you a free sample QR tag so you can see the quality and test it yourself. No obligation.

If QR memorials aren't a fit right now, no worries at all. But if you'd like to see a sample, just reply with your shipping address.

Thanks for your time,
[Your Name]
```

### Email 6: Breakup Email (14 days after initial)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

```
Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times about QR Memorial Tags for [Company Name] and haven't heard back.

I completely understand if it's not a priority right now. I'll assume the timing isn't right and won't follow up again.

But if things change, here's where we'll be:
- Website: headstonelegacy.com/partners
- Email: partners@headstonelegacy.com

Wishing you and [Company Name] continued success.

Best,
[Your Name]

## PHONE SCRIPTS

### Cold Call Script - Funeral Home

**Goal:** Get 10-minute meeting scheduled (don't sell on cold call)

```
[Gatekeeper]
"Hi, this is [Name] with Headstone Legacy. I'm hoping to speak with
whoever handles your service offerings or merchandise. Is that
[Owner Name] or someone else?"

[If asked what it's about]
"We work with funeral homes on a new memorial product - digital QR
memorials. Takes just 2 minutes to explain. Is [Name] available?"

[Decision Maker - Opening]
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with Headstone Legacy. Do you have
just two minutes? I promise I'll be brief."

[Wait for yes]

"Thanks. We help funeral homes offer QR memorial tags to families.
It's a small tag that attaches to a headstone - visitors scan it with
their phone and see a full digital memorial with photos and stories.

For funeral homes, it's a new revenue stream - about $30-50 profit per
tag, no inventory needed. A lot of families are asking for this now.

Would you be open to a 10-minute call this week where I can show you
how it works and what other funeral homes are doing with it?"

[Handle objections - see below]

[Close]
"Great, how's [Day] at [Time]? I'll send a calendar invite with a
link. What's the best email to send that to?"
```

---

### Objection Handling

**"We're not interested"**
```
"I totally understand. Just curious - is it the concept you're not
interested in, or just bad timing? If timing, I can follow up in a
few months."
```

**"We already have something like this"**
```
"Oh interesting - what are you using? [Listen] Got it. Ours might be
different - we handle everything including production and shipping.
Might be worth a quick comparison. Would 10 minutes be helpful?"
```

**"Send me information"**
```
"Happy to. I'll send our partner info sheet. What's the best email?
And after you've had a chance to review - maybe end of the week -
could we schedule a quick call to answer any questions? What day
works?"
```

**"How much does it cost?"**
```
"Great question. Wholesale pricing starts at $20-25 per tag depending
on volume. Most funeral homes retail them at $59-79, so $30-50 profit
per tag. Can I walk you through the full pricing on a quick call?"
```

**"Families won't want this"**
```
"I hear that sometimes. What we're seeing is about 15-20% of families
say yes when it's offered. At that rate, for a funeral home doing 100
services a year, that's 15-20 extra sales at $30+ profit each. Low
effort, no downside. Worth testing?"
```
